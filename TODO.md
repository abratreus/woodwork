# TODO: Make Login and Cadastro Screens Responsive for Mobile and Fix Captcha Responsiveness

- [x] Update Conta.css to reduce padding on .login-form for mobile screens
- [x] Add responsive styles for ReCAPTCHA component
- [x] Test the changes on mobile view (server running on http://localhost:5174/)
- [x] Ensure Cadastro.jsx uses the same responsive styles for consistency (both use .login-form class)
